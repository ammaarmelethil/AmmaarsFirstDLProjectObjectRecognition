1. Built a basic neural network using keras from tensorflow, was able to achieve accuracy for label~image relationship of ~= 40% where accuracy became stationary around 7 Epochs.

2. Adopted transfer learning technique: Using pre-trained model ResNet50, accuracy of 97.6% at 10 Epochs. *The code for training this model is commented out because I don't own a powerful enough computer, got results from a different computer but was unable to commit to this repository*
